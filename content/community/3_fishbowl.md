Once per semester, the program brings in one high-profile leader to come and speak to the students in the program. These leaders have been of various calibers, from a cook in Spokane to a high up the executive ladder at Amazon. It takes the place of one class session in the semester, and every student gathers together in one auditorium to learn as one program. My favorite fishbowl experience was with [Charitie Ropati](https://www.charitieropati.com/) - an indigenous rights activist and student at Columbia University. 

I loved this talk because this was the first high-profile leader to come into our space that was practically our age. The fact that she was doing incredible work that was making a difference in the world while still being a student made her highly relatable. She talked extensively about the power of youth - her biggest inspirations are drawn from her younger silbings who help her realize that youth are the smartest people on this earth. She also talked extensively on how she fought agism throughout her leadership journey. She talked about how young peoples lived experiences are always valuable because of the differences in the world which we grew up in. Because of this, she's used that to her advantage in her leadership by highlighting some lived experiences from her childhood. Additionally, she talked extensively about finding adult mentors who trust and support you. Charitie described an instance where a professor was not being fair with the assignments and grading in her class, so she used a trusted mentor to help her fight for her education since her tactics were not working well. 

In general, fishbowls are an exciting experience. You normally are used to learning within your cohort, but fishbowl is the one experience every semester you get to learn as a true CLP community. Everyone walks into the auditorium inspired and ready to learn. The conversations that follow between the students and the speakers are always a joy to participate in. The leadership fishbowls will definitely be an experience that I will miss upon graduating.
