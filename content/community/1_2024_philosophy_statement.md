> "Leadership is the opportunity to engineer people and spaces to produce positive experiences in the world." *Trevor Bushnell, Class of 2024*

When being asked to write my definition of leadership at the end of the semester, my STEM brain immediately kicked into gear. Throughout this entire minor, we've been learning not just how to be good leaders, but effective leaders that will make a dent in the world that we live in. But positive change doesn't come from one person - it comes from a group of people wanting to follow your vision. Leadership to me has been the opportunity to build spaces of safety, spaces of imagination, space of ingenuity, and vulnerability. Creating these kinds of spaces encourages people to be their best selves and gives them a place to shape their personalities and passions. Together, we can change the world for the better - we just get the opportunity to start and build that change in our immediate circle.
