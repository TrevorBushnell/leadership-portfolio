## Welcome to my Leadership Portfolio

The Comprehensive Leadership Program (or CLP for short) is a 21-credit intense program for a chohort of roughly 40 students to grow in their leadership. Throughout the program, students build skills in team building, conflict resolution, leadership theory, servant leadership, and so much more. 

I have had the wonderful privilege of being included in this community of leaders. Enjoy reading more about the experiences that I have had in this community.
