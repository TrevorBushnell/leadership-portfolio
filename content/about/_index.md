I'm an alumni of Gonzaga University that was a part of the Comprehensive Leadership program. Within the program, I've had the honor of serving as a TA for LDRS325: The Practice of Leadership. I've also helped organize the CLP Seminar for incoming freshman students to meet and experience the program before their first course. This program has meant the absolute world to me, and it's been an honor to surround myself with absolutely inspiring people who are going on to do way cooler things than I could ever dream of. Surrounding myself with these incredible people have pushed me to grow and be the best I can be in my endeavors post college. 

When I wasn't in CLP, I studied Applied Mathematics and Choral Conducting. In my last year of undergraduate studies, I served as the Assistant Conductor for the Gonzaga choral program, where I conducted concerts and helped organize and run community choral events for high school students. I'm currently taking a gap year in the Spokane area, but after that I will go on to get my masters in Choral Conducting.

Outside of my schoolwork, I'm an avid choir nerd. I've sung with every classical ensemble on campus and had the opportunity to travel to Italy with my choir peers in the Spring of 2023 and to Germany in Spring of 2025. You can catch me performing around the community with the Spokane Symphony Chorale and my barbershop quartet, the Odd Men Out. You can also catch me beating all my friends on the pickleball courts - when the weather is warm enough of course!
