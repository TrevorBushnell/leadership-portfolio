![Me](/profile_pic.jpg)

I'm currently a senior at Gonzaga University studying to get my Leadership Studies minor within the Comprehensive Leadership program. Within the program, I've had the honor of serving as a TA for LDRS325: The Practice of Leadership. I've also helped organize the CLP Seminar for incoming freshman students to meet and experience the program before their first course. This program has meant the absolute world to me, and it's been an honor to surround myself with absolutely inspiring people who are going on to do way cooler things than I could ever dream of. Surrounding myself with these incredible people has pushed me to grow and be the best I can be in my endeavors post college. 

When not in CLP, I am studying Applied Mathematics with a focus in Statistics and Data Science. After I graduate, I will be pursuing a job in data science with the hope of staying in the Spokane area so I can give back to the city that has shaped me into the person I'm proud to be today.

Outside of my schoolwork, I'm an avid choir nerd. I've sung with every classical ensemble on campus and had the opportunity to travel to Italy with my choir peers in the Spring of 2023. You can catch me performing at our remaining Gonzaga choir concerts this spring or around the community with the Spokane Symphony Chorale and my barbershop quartet, the ZagTags. I'll also be directing and conducting a project on AI generated choral music for my honors thesis this coming spring.
