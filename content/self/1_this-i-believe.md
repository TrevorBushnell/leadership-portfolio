title: "This I Believe Statement - Be a Good Neighbor"
---
I grew up in a typical rural neighborhood. Nice house, lots of bedrooms, lots of siblings to play with. But more importantly, we had neighbors on every side of our house. Even better - those neighbors had kids my age to play with. 

We lived in a cul-de-sac. Houses structured in a circle with a circle of pavement in the middle. Kids living in every home. All the same age. All itching for some fun at any moment. And fun we had. One of the parents put up a basketball hoop in front of their driveway. We would play basketball, race our bikes and scooters in Mario Kart fashion, turn our cul-de-sac into a kickball stadium. The fun was always abounding. We even let the neighbors behind my house hop our fence and go through our backyard so that they could play with us too. 

We were great neighborhood friends. We were always talking and laughing with each other. We were each other’s support group through elementary school - comforting each other when people got bullied, celebrating victories from their rec sports teams, and making fun of me because I was always doing the math competitions (hey, looking back I would have done it too).

The older we got, the more friends we found through school and our other various activities. However, despite us getting on in age, we were always coming back to the cul-de-sac to hang out with each other. Sure, maybe it wasn’t every afternoon right when we got home from school. But it was more frequent than the other kids hung out with their neighbors. We built relationships that lasted our childhood when we were kids. We invested in each other’s lives, valued each other’s differences. We helped each other with our school work, we gave each other girl advice, and we were there for each other when pets and other loved ones passed away. Through all of this, I couldn’t help but compare ourselves to the other kids at our school and notice that the older we got, the more successful we were in life than the rest of the kids.

We can make all sorts of theories. We can say it was because we lived in a nicer neighborhood. We can say it was because our parents raised us better. Maybe those factors mattered. But in my head, we were successful because we made continued investments in each other throughout our entire childhood. We had our neighborhood friend group. We practiced leadership amongst each other. Looking back, I attribute much of my success to my neighborhood friends. 

Want to be a good leader? Try being a good neighbor first. You’d be surprised to see the gradual impact you’ll have on their lives and the insane amount of growth that you will undergo because of it.
