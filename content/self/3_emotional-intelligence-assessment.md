title: "Emotional Intelligence Assessment"
---

Sophomore spring was my favorite class in the program. LDRS325: The Practice of Leadership forces students to think about everything they've learned in their first year and apply it to their leadership roles throughout their campus experiences. Part of this class is focused around **emotional intelligence** - how you can work on other people. I remember hearing from my classmates about how weird the process of taking the exam was. It took exactly an hour, and we were put in situations within an organization where we would have to make decisions as a boss. Despite our unconformability taking the exam, the results were absolutely shocking and specific.

Here were my results to my EQ assessment (we would call this my EQ profile):

These results were very eye-opening. Some elements of these results were exactly how I envisioned things would turn out. For example, I knew that I would have a high access to the emotion of shame because I would constantly self-punish myself in my childhood for any action that I thought was wrong. Seeing that reminded me that I still need to work on how I control my shame as a leader. Additionally, my high scores in empathy made sense to me because of my core belief of adding value to people. I always live life in a way that uplifts the people around me and lets them know how much they matter. In order to do that successfully, you have to have a natural aptitude towards empathy.

Some things on this profile were surprising too. I never expected that I would even be in the "fit" ranking for access to range of feelings. I have Asperger's Syndrome which means that I have a hard time in social situations. I also have a hard time wanting to identify and wrestle with my feelings. As such, it was shocking to me that I was getting a decent score at all - it shows that I've been growing over the years despite the barriers that I have as a person.

One thing that I've been working on since seeing these results is my balance of thoughts, wants, and feelings as it was my lowest scoring element. I'm completely balanced on what I want in my life and I rarely consult how I'm actually feeling. While I am decent at identifying my feelings, I still would rather rely on other aspects of myself instead of my feelings. As such, I've since been tapping into and discussing my feelings more before I make any large decisions. The great thing about emotional intelligence is unlike your IQ, your EQ can be improved. This tool was a great way for me to identify where I currently stand in my social interactions and how I can improve so that my interactions with others can be more impactful and more effecitve.
