    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>The very first project in CLP is the <strong>best self project</strong>. In that project, we had to ask a bunch of people who knew us really well what was unique and inspiring about us. Then, we had to come up with a creative way to combine all of that into a creative presentation. Some people wrote poems. Some people had props. Some people played games. I gave a TED talk.</p>
<p>Yes, I realize that&rsquo;s quirky and weird. What was worse was that I gave a math TED Talk - explaining crazy math problems. This was a huge risk - how do I connect the best things about me to math? Nobody likes math.</p>
<p>However, the math I talked about were theoretical math problems that existed to be interesting and nothing else. The major math problem I described was to suppose there were two blocks in front of a wall on a frictionless surface. The blocks start at an equal weight of 1kg. Send the block in the back towards the block in the front and count the number of perfect collisions between the blocks and the wall. If you repeat this process but increase the weight of the back block by a factor of 100, the number of collisions traces $\pi$. This is WILD because there is no circle in this problem, but this problem is just a great story to tell. I compared it to a math problem with a real application - The Fourier Transformation. Using this math tool, you have the ability to take a bunch of sounds that are within one wave and decompress it into all the individual sounds that make up the big sound.</p>
<p>The major connection I made to the people with me was that some people saw the typical leadership aspects in me. They saw that I was determined. They saw that I was a hard worker. They saw that I had perseverance. This is like the math problem with the real application. However, some people said that they appreciated how resourceful I was. They appreciated my creativity and my care and compassion for the people that I interact with. This is like the math problem with no application. Sometimes leadership is more than just the real life application. It&rsquo;s about the small interactions with people. Sure, these don&rsquo;t have an application to the real problem being solved. Yet they teach people about how to care and value others, and when others are valued they produce better work in the long run.</p>
<p>The presentation was a smashing success&hellip; well almost. We had to give these presentations during COVID which was hard because some people were on Zoom. While my lecture was really powerful to the people in the room, I completely forgot to screenshare my slides to the people on the Zoom call. One of the Zoom students mentioned that I never shared the screen and I was completely heartbroken. But what followed was one of the craziest compliments I&rsquo;ve ever received - my passion is infectious and cool to watch. This meant a lot to me because even without the tools and gadgets that I had at my disposal to make my project better, people still saw the real me. Even without assistance, I was able to still show off my best self. This meant the world to me and was incredibly affirming.</p>
<p>All in all, the best self project was my favorite project I had participated in throughout my entire time in this program.</p>
