      <description>The very first project in CLP is the best self project. In that project, we had to ask a bunch of people who knew us really well what was unique and inspiring about us. Then, we had to come up with a creative way to combine all of that into a creative presentation. Some people wrote poems. Some people had props. Some people played games. I gave a TED talk.</description>

      <description>Sophomore spring was my favorite class in the program. LDRS325: The Practice of Leadership forces students to think about everything they&amp;rsquo;ve learned in their first year and apply it to their leadership roles throughout their campus experiences. Part of this class is focused around emotional intelligence - how you can work on other people. I remember hearing from my classmates about how weird the process of taking the exam was. It took exactly an hour, and we were put in situations within an organization where we would have to make decisions as a boss.</description>

      <title>This I Believe Statement - Play in the Cul-de-sac</title>

      <description>I grew up in a typical rural neighborhood. Nice house, lots of bedrooms, lots of siblings to play with. But more importantly, we had neighbors on every side of our house. Even better - those neighbors had kids my age to play with.
We lived in a cul-de-sac. Houses structured in a circle with a circle of pavement in the middle. Kids living in every home. All the same age. All itching for some fun at any moment.</description>
