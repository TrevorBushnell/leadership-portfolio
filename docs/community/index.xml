      <description>All of us are in CLP because we want to grow in our leadership. We want to be able to practice in the areas of leadership we already serve in so that we can be great leaders upon graduating and entering the workforce. My main source of leadership that I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten to practice with has been through the Gonzaga Choirs Program.&#xA;Starting my junior year of college, I served as the unofficial Glee chair for the Gonzaga Glee Club - the tenor/bass ensemble on campus.</description>

      <description>Once per semester, the program brings in one high-profile leader to come and speak to the students in the program. These leaders have been of various calibers, from a cook in Spokane to a high up the executive ladder at Amazon. It takes the place of one class session in the semester, and every student gathers together in one auditorium to learn as one program. My favorite fishbowl experience was with Charitie Ropati - an indigenous rights activist and student at Columbia University.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Leadership is the opportunity to engineer people and spaces to produce positive experiences in the world.&amp;rdquo; Trevor Bushnell, Class of 2024&#xA;When being asked to write my definition of leadership at the end of the semester, my STEM brain immediately kicked into gear. Throughout this entire minor, we&amp;rsquo;ve been learning not just how to be good leaders, but effective leaders that will make a dent in the world that we live in.</description>
