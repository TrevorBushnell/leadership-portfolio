      <description>Once per semester, the program brings in one high-profile leader to come and speak to the students in the program. These leaders have been of various calibers, from a cook in Spokane to a high up the executive ladder at Amazon. It takes the place of one class session in the semester, and every student gathers together in one auditorium to learn as one program. My favorite fishbowl experience was with Charitie Ropati - an indigenous rights activist and student at Columbia University.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Leadership is the opportunity to engineer people and spaces to produce positive experiences in the world.&amp;rdquo; Trevor Bushnell, Class of 2024

Throughout this entire minor, we&amp;rsquo;ve been learning not just how to be good leaders, but effective leaders that will make a dent in the world that we live in.</description>
