      <description>As a part of the final senior class in CLP, students are required to participate in a legacy project - a team capstone project with the goal of giving back to Gonzaga, either directly to the CLP community or to the Gonzaga community as a whole. For our project, we led the CLP Seminar. The CLP Seminar is an event held the weekend after the incoming freshman class is selected and notified of their acceptance.</description>

      <title>TA for LDRS325 - The Practice of Leadership</title>

      <description>While there is a set track of classes that we all have to take in order to get our leadership minor at Gonzaga, we also get the opportunity to take two classes of our choosing to broaden our leadership experience. One of my choices was getting to be one of four student TAs for the freshman and sophomore spring CLP classes. Being a TA is a huge privilege in the program because you have to apply and be chosen by the professor teaching the course.</description>
