      <description>As a part of the final senior class in CLP, students are required to participate in a legacy project - a team capstone project with the goal of giving back to Gonzaga, either directly to the CLP community or to the Gonzaga community as a whole. For our project, we led the CLP Seminar. The CLP Seminar is an event held the weekend after the incoming freshman class is selected and notified of their acceptance.</description>

      <description>While there is a set track of classes that we all have to take in order to get our leadership minor at Gonzaga, we also get the opportunity to take two classes of our choosing to broaden our leadership experience. One of my choices was getting to be one of four student TAs for the freshman and sophomore spring CLP classes. Being a TA is a huge privilege in the program because you have to apply and be chosen by the professor teaching the course.</description>

      <title>The World Needs a Data-Driven Leader</title>

      <description>The leadership minor here at Gonzaga gives a general overview of how to be a leader. No matter your industry, you will inevitably have to be working on teams, navigating some sort of conflict, and working on yourself to be a better leader for your co-workers. What they don&amp;rsquo;t teach you is how that applies to your field of study - and why should they? My favorite part of CLP was seeing the wide variety of majors in the room - and the fact that very few of them were business majors, something where you would expect leadership to be highly prevalent.</description>
