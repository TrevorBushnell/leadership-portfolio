    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>While there is a set track of classes that we all have to take in order to get our leadership minor at Gonzaga, we also get the opportunity to take two classes of our choosing to broaden our leadership experience. One of my choices was getting to be one of four student TAs for the freshman and sophomore spring CLP classes. Being a TA is a huge privilege in the program because you have to apply and be chosen by the professor teaching the course. As such, I was honored when Kristin Plouffe, my favorite CLP professor (and arguably one of my favorite professors at Gonzaga) offered me a TA position to help her teach The Practice of Leadership - my favorite class in CLP - for the Class of 2025.</p>
<p><img alt="The Class of 2025" src="/common_good_ta_3.jpeg"></p>
<p>Little did I know that this would be more demanding semester than the TAs who came before me. The first meeting, Kristin opened the floor to what their CLP experience has been like in the past and what we can do as instructors moving forward to better suit them. What followed was a mix of emotions and rocky experiences that caused some of them to drop out of the program before coming into our class, or at the very least have severed relationships with others in the room and a general sense of demotivation in CLP. At the same time, Kristin and I learned how incredibly passionate this class was - they wanted intense dialogue where they could share <em>anything</em> and learn from each other. I&rsquo;ve never seen so much passion for leadership and learning from any community the way the Class of 2025 shared.</p>
<p>With all of this information armed at our disposal, we got ready to teach the course. Not only did we have the job of teaching exciting leadership content that would force everyone in the room to get out of their seats</p>
<p>Additionally, the TA roles that semester were heavier than normal because of the situations of the instructing team. The professor of the other section (Ben Chu) was feeling the pressure of having to balance a travelling job, teaching, and a family of then-two (now three) young children. Kristin was&hellip; let&rsquo;s just say &ldquo;fully experiencing life&rdquo; through some incredible hardships in her personal life as well as the wonderful high of getting engaged - all within a matter of weeks. This left tons of pressure on myself and the other TA, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/unioncarter/">Union Carter</a>, to be a backup in the room when professors needed a moment of break and rest at any moment in time. There were moments where Ben simply had to be out of town and Union brilliantly held down the fort all on her own. When Kristin was coming to a night class after a long day with both family and her full time job, I would jump in to teach one extra activity to give her space and not completely break down.</p>
<p>The major word that we the instruction team rallied behind was <strong>pivot</strong>. Depending on the circumstances of us the instructors, as well as the excitement and energy of the students themselves, we needed to be ready to adapt our entire plan at a moments notice. This is not something that I have excelled at as a leader. I always appreciate having a plan of attack, and while we did have weekly meetings to plan the structure and activities for ecah class, there was never a week where we ever followed everything on the plan. Every week, there was a moment where an activity would run too long, or the discussion would be incredibly exciting, or some other hiccup in the teaching process that we did not account for. Being able to adapt to a challenge (or in our language, <em>pivot</em> on the spot) is incredibly difficult. It requires quick thinking and trusting your gut - things I find difficult as I often second guess myself. However, I forced myself to be more fexible and pivot more often because I cared deeply about the students and Kristin. I wanted the students to feel like they were in a safe space, so I would often have to pivot activity ideas or discussion questions to accommodate what the students were interested in talking about. If Kristin was having a particularly rough week, I would pivot and teach a topic that was supposed to be Kristin&rsquo;s, even though I did not prepare it myself. As the semester went on, I felt more comfortable with pivoting, and I&rsquo;m grateful for Kristin and Ben&rsquo;s mentorship in guiding me through this growth in my leadership.</p>
<p>The TA role concluded with the opportunity to lesson plan and teach an entire class with the help of the other TA. I could not be more grateful to work with such an amazing individual as Union. Together, we planned a class reviewing each of the main units of the course, with the theme of a <em>Leadership Trip Around the World</em>. Our first activity was a Minefield-esque activity where students compete in teams to try to get through a maze in which they don&rsquo;t know the correct path out. Our second activity was an EQ Karaoke party, where students had to pick a song that matches an emotion, talk about why they performed that song, and then perform it! Our final activity had the two sections particpate in debates at the United Nations headquarters in attempt to create and resolve conflict. Throughout the entire process, I had a seamless experience working with Union on developing the entire class, and we executed it flawlessly (how rarely does that happen?!). The students also had an absolute blast the entire day which helped affirm our hard work throughout the entire semester.</p>
<p><img alt="us admiring our final planned class!" src="/common_good_ta_1.jpeg"></p>
<p>In the end, I&rsquo;m so grateful for Ben, Kristin, and Union for teaching me so much and allowing me to use mentorship and teaching (my favorite aspects of leadership) to help grow myself as a leader. I&rsquo;m also so incredibly grateful to the CLP Class of 2025 for giving me grace and patience as I navigated teaching. It was definitely a challenge at the beginning with a steep learning curve, and I&rsquo;m so excited that I got to impact so many students through my work - and encourage them to even take my place as they get older!</p>
